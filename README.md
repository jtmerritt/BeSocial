- redo data import to better support a per contact update
- Update contact stats when a communication happens
+ Create class to estimate contact due date
+ Create routine for producing the long duration statistics:
    - average time
    - score over time
- Have a nightly database maintenance routine
- Method to edit contact settings
- figure out what to do with the event notes

- make groups editor show mosaic of contact photos of it's photo
- re-evaluate what needs to be saved when a fragment goes into the background
 - may be related to crashes

- background images
    - from text messages
    - internet source
        - picasso
        - facebook
    - display generic photo

- make cards interface
- flag for manually entered events?

***Bug List***
- OnClick listener in the groupsEditor interface is broken
- crashing when contact notes are updated
- Crashing when flipping contacts
- Is it a problem that the method that creates the master contact list for the update, is also
    reading from the Misses You list?
+ [bug] the scroll position for the current detail view affects the chart loading for the next page
    - premature loading of the chart
- when the detail stats range is chosen, the background photo position shifts
- Fix bug: The user should not be able to delete contacts from the search results in the Contact List
- Make the Cancel update button work.
- fix update auto-run
- fix onResume for wordCloud


***Future***
- add another option to the CAB:
    - Move selection to another group
    -
- Event Entry Fragment: Add a mapping interface button to pull a new address/place
- context/item help
- Fix the title and userpic display of the action bar

    - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19292605/android-viewpager-actionbar-and-android-app-fragments
    - Or just replace it with a custom menu bar with the frosted glass effect
- group stats must be collected just like contact stats
+ Word cloud
    - words you use with others but don't use with the current contact
- add "Average Reply Time" to the detail stats display
- Social event viewer
    - have a feature to display the library of tags
- Access facebook through official API: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/android
- Need to have some kind of happy chime and message after making contact with a friend
- Access hangouts data: ?
- On the chart, it would be nice to display the data value.  But changing setDisplayChartValues(true)  crashes the program.
- Figure out how to cluster events into a conversation
- Figure out how to calculate average reply time
- Create cards viewer for special data
    - Create a first-time startup UI
    - infrequent charts
    - feature notifications
    - make animation for welcome screen
- interface for other applications to send text to this, and enter that text into the event database with full analysis
- For periodic database updates, it may be faster just to do it by message, rather than contact
- Make the welcome screen update skip if the last update was very recent



***Not Sure if Needed***
- fix crash when setDisplayChartValues(true) for renderer_SMS
- Is it possible to monitor when communication happens from a different app?
- Find a cluster analysis package.
- Cloud-based backup?
- disallow viewPager for chartView - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19359516/achartengine-with-panning-inside-a-viewpager
- Save output of chart engine as bitmap? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3107527/android-save-view-to-jpg-or-png
- Implement listeners for the preference changes (http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/settings.html)
